## Features

- **Pre-Download Server Assets**: Allows you to pre-download all the necessary server assets before joining a gameserver.
- Join the server without having to modify the launch options of the game.
- Download the current map automatically.
- When the server changes the map, it will be downloaded automatically and you will join the server without having to do anything.
- The launcher is automatically updated when a new version is released.
- The system will check if any files on the gameserver have changed and will be overwritten on the player's local client.

## TO-DO

Here are some features and improvements we're planning to add in the future:

- [ ] Load your local favorites
- [ ] Download assets between maps (not only the maps as now)
- [ ] Linux compatibility

## How to use
1. Download the [latest version](https://github.com/CS2Browser/Launcher/releases/latest) of the executable. **IMPORTANT: The code is not signed, so it is very likely that both the web browser and the operating system will tell you that it is not secure.**
2. Select the server you want to play (double-click or click the PLAY button).
3. Click on the Download Assets button to start downloading the content needed to play on the server.
